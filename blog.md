<p>Hello world.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about this idea for a minute, what if we all just went back to HTML + CSS for most things. So, that is what this little site is all about really, can I make it just 4-5 simple HTML pages with inline CSS (so nothing external to the page to load).</p>

<p>This is a GitHub page as well, <a href="https://github.com/mcdwayne/new-dwayne-mcdaniel.com">so it is open source if you really want to see the code, for some reason</a>.</p>

<p>And since it is hosted, for free, on GitHub, that means, I also get a way for you to leave comments and suggest direct edits, in case you disagree or can point where I am factually wrong. Again, for free.</p>

<p>I am writing this in markdown and transalting into HTML via local tool. I did use AI to help with the grunt work of adjusting the CSS to be all inline and sometimes I am just lazy.</p>

<p>But the words are all mine.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by,</p>

<p>Dwayne</p>
